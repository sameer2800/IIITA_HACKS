<b>Smart Facebook Birthday Assistant </b> 

How many times have we spent hours to think of a way to wish someone on his/her special day or reply to someone’s birthday wish on our wall! We do it based on how close they are to us in our life, right? What if i tell you based on your facebook chat with the person, there will be automated posts on the person’s wall and automated replies to people’s posts on your wall!
Yes our project is there to make it easy for you

<b>How we are doing this </b> <br/>
1. We are reading the messages using the fb's api <br/>
2. We are applying machine learning to classify the messages <br/>
3. The machine learning API gives the measure of neutral, positive, negative and irrelevance in the message content. <br/>
4. We will use this probablity to classify the users as good friend, normal friend and just friend. <br/>
5. Based on above classification the posts and reply will be made on the friends wall. <br/>
